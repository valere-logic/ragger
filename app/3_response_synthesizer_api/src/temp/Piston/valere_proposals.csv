One thing that really draws me to new projects is the potential or ""level of innovation"" I can find hiding behind requests and requirements. As an Advisor and investor at Game Gym, a CEO at Fitivity Inc., and a CEO at Elete, I've seen it all and have a keen eye for catching innovative projects.

I have a team that is extremely diverse in terms of our skill set, capabilities, and experience across Web3 Development. We have been heavily focused on the Crypto & NFT space and feel like these experiences and expertise will lend themselves well to the development of your project.

As you probably already know, finding GOOD crypto/blockchain/NFT developers right now that are available and not backlogged for months is nearly impossible.We have recently become available and are looking for our next big project. With that being said, we only pick projects that we have a strong affection for, and after reviewing your project description, I honestly believe that this seems like a great fit. I’d like to entertain the idea of building something incredible together.

I strongly encourage you to check out a few recently completed projects that showcase our diverse skills in the blockchain space.

Our capabilities have enabled us to build several blockchain-related products, for instance, mintable.app
We helped Mintable create one of the first open-sea-esq platforms where you can mint your own NFTs, track important stats in the blockchain world, and even sign up for their DAO.

We also helped Crypto Homes create the first fully functional marketplace to buy and sell homes using cryptocurrency. The website currently does not have live info on it, because the client experienced quite a setback with marketing and getting people to list their houses since the crypto crash. cryptohomes.com/properties

Full Stack Development,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01c84a9d7156b877cc,"Hello. I am in the energy industry (solar) and I am looking to develop a system where other solar companies can go and have an AI platform design a whole solar system from start to end. I want it to be able for the white label so we need to be able to work with other companies' APIs like financing and CRM etc...
Please take a look at http://www.solarquote.com/ and see what I mean. only apply once you understand the project. of course, more information will be provided.","Hi there, I'm glad to have found this AI project. I've been pushing AI in the solar industry and finding someone like yourself who's interested in the topic isn't that easy! So, I'm going to cut straight to the chase. Here's how I'd break down this build:

1. Requirement Analysis:
Gather detailed requirements through market research and user analysis.
Define functional specifications, including user roles, data flow, and interaction with external APIs for solar data.
2. System Architecture:
Design a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability or opt for a monolithic architecture for simpler deployment and management, depending on the expected scale.
Decide on a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for hosting the application, considering factors like scalability, services offered, and cost.
3. Front-End Development:
Choose a modern JavaScript framework or library (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Implement state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Vuex) if the application complexity requires it.
Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling and to accelerate the development process.
4. Back-End Development:
Select a back-end programming language and framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django, Ruby on Rails) that aligns with the performance needs and developer expertise.
Develop RESTful APIs or GraphQL for front-end to back-end communication.
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT, to secure user accounts and data.
5. Database Design:
Choose an appropriate database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL) based on the data structure and access patterns.
Normalize the database to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
Implement proper indexing to optimize query performance.
6. Quote Calculation Engine:
Develop a custom algorithm or engine that takes into account various factors like location, energy usage, local solar irradiance data, and financial incentives to generate accurate quotes.
Integrate with third-party APIs to pull in real-time data for more accurate and dynamic quote generation.
7. Third-Party Integrations:
Integrate with CRM systems to manage customer interactions and follow-ups.
Connect with solar provider databases to fetch real-time pricing and service offerings.
Use mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps API) for location-based services and calculations.
8. Security Measures:
Implement HTTPS with SSL certificates for secure data transmission.
Use secure coding practices to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
9. Testing:
Write unit and integration tests for both front-end and back-end components.
Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle high traffic.
Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix security issues.
10. Deployment:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
Use containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes if the application's complexity and scale warrant it.
Monitor the application using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack for logging and performance metrics.
11. User Analytics and SEO:
Implement analytics tracking with tools like Google Analytics for user behavior analysis.
Optimize the platform for search engines, ensuring proper meta tags, sitemaps, and robot.txt files are in place.

If you think you’re a good fit for this project, we would love to hear from you","Hi, I love the Real Estate space and get excited when I come across innovative real estate technology or people looking to create complex CRMs or Zillow-like platforms. I’m very interested in learning more about your project. I'm a package deal if you decide to work with me. When you work with me, I supply you with front-end and back-end developers, UX and UI designers, project managers, account managers, and quality assurance experts. This collective expertise ensures that every aspect of your project is handled by a specialist, resulting in a higher-quality end product.

I've spent 10+ years creating award-winning software that is fast, attractive, responsive, and easy to use. I have thousands of hours logged on UpWork with a 100% success score, and I'm Top Rated Plus (Top 3% of ALL Upwork!). My work has been featured by Apple, Google, TechRadar, and the New York Times! In 2009, I started the largest mobile fitness app at the time called Fitivity, which achieved over 15 million downloads and raised $1.5 million.

After Fitivity, I worked with in-house developers, off-shore freelancers, and agencies. I saw what worked and what didn't. I dealt with all kinds of developers who just wanted my money and didn't care about my product.

The process was broken. After 2 successful exits, I decided to re-invest and fix the process. That is what led me to create Valere Labs (http://www.valere.io/) with the fundamental thesis to use my experience developing high-quality software to help others 1) Do it Right, 2) Do it Efficiently, and 3) Do it Ethically.

Check out these platforms we’ve recently built in this space:

It undoubtedly speaks volumes about the relevance and impact of your work in industries as diverse as international sports, Hollywood production, and investment banking. Honestly speaking, I only pick projects that I have a strong affection for, and after reviewing your project description, I truly believe that this seems like a great fit.

I can’t tell you how many clients have come to us looking help after their freelancer randomly jumped ship or delivered poor quality code that made it impossible for them to scale. The thing is, freelancers can be a single point of failure. If they become unavailable or face a personal issue, your project could stall. We would midigate that risk as there are backup resources and a project manager to ensure continuity. While a single freelancer might cut corners on testing due to time or resource constraints, we have a dedicated quality assurance team.

Deep Learning,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~014e7290223c461f54,"I get a list of FMCSA-registered commercial truck and bus drivers each month. There are a total of 1,500,000 Owner-Operators. Half of them or 750,000 have to file a renewal each year or Biennially or they are put out of service for 2-3 days and also can be but rarely are fined up to $1,000 per day. But the potential of the fine does serve as a good motivator to get them filed. I solicit these drivers with emails and outbound calls to file the forms for them. 97% of them do not know how or do not want to file the forms themselves so, they link up with me or someone like me and pay a fee to get it filed for them. So I take the data from the FMCSA, split it, and then pick out the contacts to email and call by the last two digits of their DOT number. I need a CRM to control everything. The CRM does not have to be very sophisticated at this point but it eventually needs to be a platform that can eventually interface with other third-party programs. I currently have a website that will suffice, but I want to improve it. I have e-commerce through Stripe, but it is now linked to my current CRM which will be replaced. So I need to coordinate with Stripe to change it. I have very limited capital but would be willing to get up some equity in the company. It is an LLC so income flows through. You would always have income from it as long as it is operational or until it is sold. If it is sold then you get a piece if the sales, based on your equity position But if I gave up Equity I would really want someone strong who could help me build this thing.","Ronnie, I appreciate your open and candid description of your business and the challenges you're facing.

We integrated a built-in custom Tracking System, inventory management system, supply chain management, inventory management, production planning, CRM and more. It was so successful that our client was interviewed and featured by Upwork.

Here's a snip-it of the article, ""A few years ago, I decided to take our company from a paper-based system to a full-blown, tech-enabled business,” said Ryan McCrae, General Manager of Bee Line Transport, a transportation company based in Oregon. Ryan’s father had started the business and asked him to take over just two years before his passing. “I felt a responsibility to make our company what I knew it could be. I started looking on Upwork, talked to a few developers, and eventually landed with Valere Labs. From flow charts and specifications of exactly what we wanted to the finished project, Valere was amazing.”

By leveraging machine learning and AI, Valere helped Ryan facilitate a digital transformation of his transportation business. Now, drivers log into Bee Line’s IOS app with their thumbprint; keep track of receipts from car washes, tolls, and more; and have instant access to all of the information they need to embark on their next job from their fingertips, wherever they are. “This has helped us retain employees and in turn improve our customer service,” Ryan said. The app uses AI to scan a label applied to every vehicle, which feeds into a full database that provides Ryan and his team with a real-time view of every detail of their business. “We used to work with stacks of worksheets and tally them up, one by one,” Ryan said. ""

lessHow do you deal with outliers or missing values in a dataset?We handle outliers by using math and statistics to understand if they are meaningful or should be adjusted. For missing data, we fill in the gaps using methods that make sense for the type of data and why it's missing. Our goal is to keep the data accurate and useful.What tools do you use for data mining and visualization?It depends on the project. For managing FMCSA driver data and compliance, I'd recommend you use Python for data handling, web scraping tools for driver contacts, databases for storing info, and consider cloud services.

Creating an educational version of MMORPG would undoubtedly be an engaging and impactful platform. I am excited to learn more about your project and to share more about our team at Valere. Before we schedule a meeting, I want to be transparent about our company policy. We have a limited number of developers and are fully committed to producing high-quality work, which is why we only pick projects that we have a strong affection for. This means that our developers will work exclusively on your project during the entire development process, engaging quality assurance, designers, and project manager to ensure everything is going smoothly and make sure we give you a product that could be built upon as your business grows. For this reason, we are very selective about the projects we choose to work on.

As part of our commitment to delivering top-notch software development solutions, we ensure that every client we work with has $20k+ for long-term software development. This allocation doesn't have to be for the first task specifically, but we want to ensure that adequate resources are available over time to support your project's growth and success. We spend a lot of time and mental energy on every client, that is why we only pursue long term relationships.

Let me know if this aligns with your long-term interests and bandwidth for this project.

Full Stack Development,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013229389e2139bb01,"I have a local painting client that has a static site on Hugo. I do all of his SEO and need someone that can help me with the technical side of his website. I'm use to working on Wordpress sites so this side of web development is not my expertise.

I have been trained on adding blog posts but when I get any error messages I'm stumped and can't move forward in adding blog posts so would love some help with that.

Looking for someone who knows Hugo & Github and that can:

1. Create service pages when needed (he not only does painting but we also need pages for his pressure washing, staining, cabinet refinishing, and other services he offers.) Not all at once but in the future.
2. Handle any website issues that may arise such as error messages and ensuring that everything is running good for Google and the search engines.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out.

Be Blessed,
Audrey","Hello Audrey, Happy Halloween. 🎃👻

Reading your post, I felt a little bit like a kindred spirit, as I too transitioned from WordPress to static site generators. Your approach is straightforward, and it’s clear you want to optimize this Hugo site for your local painting client effectively.

I totally get the shift from WordPress to Hugo; it can be like learning a new language! Since you're handling SEO, let's ensure the technical aspect complements your efforts perfectly. From creating service pages for pressure washing, staining, cabinet refinishing, and so on, to troubleshooting any error messages you encounter, I’ve got it covered.

I'm quite adept with Hugo and GitHub, and I can also help in making sure the website remains search-engine friendly. While Hugo is my main gig, I'm familiar with the stack you mentioned—JavaScript, Gatsby.js, Node.js, and the others—so I bring a wide range of skills to the table.

Here's a glimpse of our previous work, which I believe will match with your needs:

Must be able & comfortable to communicate in face to face meetings, online with cameras on - not all the time, but simple team meetings and communication updates.","DB, first and foremost, I appreciate the invitation to check out your project. It's a great fit for my team. At Valere, we do things differently. We view each project as an opportunity to raise the bar, and your need for Angular and Ruby experts aligns perfectly with our philosophy of excellence. Your project's objective of redesigning the system, optimizing architecture, and adding micro-services is an exciting challenge, and we're ready to seize it if we determine that we would indeed be a good fit for each other.

Our extensive experience in system redesign and micro-services implementation makes us the ideal choice for your long-term project. We don't just write code; we architect efficient systems that stand the test of time.

Valere's team comprises Angular and Ruby experts who have tackled diverse projects, leaving behind a trail of efficient, secure, and robust systems. Here's a glimpse of a couple of recent projects with a similar tech stack:
🔹http://nurturebynaps.com/
Nurture By Naps has carefully curated a lineup of services, support groups and virtual classes that anticipate all the questions and needs of parents.We helped them build a platform that manages all of their paid services through a single dashboard, which includes: memberships, booking consults with Acuity, courses & events and many more such sections.

🔹https://reasymarket.com/
We created a platform that supplies brokerages and agents with marketing tools. They provide quality content that's current, fresh and relevant for social media and/or farming. They have a vast supply of Canva templates for users to choose from.

We're not just looking for another job; we're in this for the long haul. I can’t tell you how many clients have come to us looking help after their freelancer randomly jumped ship or delivered poor quality code that made it impossible for them to scale. The thing is, freelancers can be a single point of failure. If they become unavailable or face a personal issue, your project could stall. A team approach mitigates this risk as there are backup resources and a project manager to ensure continuity.

While a single freelancer might cut corners on testing due to time or resource constraints, we have a dedicated dedicated quality assurance team.

If your project grows or needs to be adapted in the future, a whole team can easily scale up to meet your requirements. A single freelancer may struggle to handle increased workloads or may not be available for additional work. We provide maintenance and support FOREVER - a lot of people ask about this one.

If you think you’re a good fit for this project, we would love to hear from you.","Hi, I love the Real Estate space and get excited when I come across innovative real estate technology or people looking to create complex CRMs or Zillow-like platforms. I’m very interested in learning more about your project. I'm a package deal if you decide to work with me. When you work with me, I supply you with front-end and back-end developers, UX and UI designers, project managers, account managers, and quality assurance experts. This collective expertise ensures that every aspect of your project is handled by a specialist, resulting in a higher-quality end product.

I've spent 10+ years creating award-winning software that is fast, attractive, responsive, and easy to use. I have thousands of hours logged on UpWork with a 100% success score, and I'm Top Rated Plus (Top 3% of ALL Upwork!). My work has been featured by Apple, Google, TechRadar, and the New York Times! In 2009, I started the largest mobile fitness app at the time called Fitivity, which achieved over 15 million downloads and raised $1.5 million.

After Fitivity, I worked with in-house developers, off-shore freelancers, and agencies. I saw what worked and what didn't. I dealt with all kinds of developers who just wanted my money and didn't care about my product.

The process was broken. After 2 successful exits, I decided to re-invest and fix the process. That is what led me to create Valere Labs (http://www.valere.io/) with the fundamental thesis to use my experience developing high-quality software to help others 1) Do it Right, 2) Do it Efficiently, and 3) Do it Ethically.

Check out these platforms we’ve recently built in this space:

DwellOptimal provides an alternative to the hotel experience by providing secure real estate solutions for corporate extended-stay travel. We helped them create an integrated software platform for managing utilization, controlling unit environments remotely and allowing employees to tailor elements of their live|work spaces.
http://cryptohomes.com/

We helped Crypto Homes create the first fully functional marketplace to buy and sell homes using cryptocurrency.
http://cryptohomes.com/

BPO Xpress contracts photography out to local drivers. Use your cell phone, your car, and a few minutes of your spare time to make as much as $70/hr completing exterior photography on vacant homes, investment properties, and apartment buildings from the exterior for banks, insurance companies, and other institutional investors.

KOVA ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATOR: 3D web platform where users can change kitchen and bathroom environments with products offered by the brand such as floors, cabinets, quartz, etc. After choosing the products, a form is sent where the supplier receives the information selected by the client to generate a quote and start a conversation.
http://simply3d.co/demos/kova_2

We created a platform that supplies brokerages and agents with marketing tools. They provide quality content that's current, fresh and relevant for social media and/or farming. They have a vast supply of Canva templates for users to choose from.

scripting and automation,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01a933cddb75969cd4,"Please see the very terribly designed mockups attached to the job post. I will improve them, but this should give you an idea of the concept.
On a budget: I just want a MVP to test the market - and then we can expand functionality if it is successful.
Functionality:
- Users create an account and can define hastags, profiles, keywords and pages to follow on FB, LI, TW.
- IN their account, they select the social media channel on the left, and then can click each tab to see the latest content or posts from what they are following.
Later:
- It would be great to allow sort order in results (relevancy, popularity) if possible
- It would be great if we could start showing trends (trending up, trending down) after collecting some data
- Expand other channels like Reddit, QUora, etc","Hi, this is right up my alley. My team and I have developed web scraping solutions for various industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. We use state-of-the-art techniques and tools to ensure the data we collect is accurate and reliable.

Additionally, our team has hands-on experience in AI technologies. We have worked on projects that require understanding and analyzing large amounts of online content/data. Our team has built custom AI models that can identify and extract key insights from text-based data. We have also leveraged pre-trained models to provide our clients with solutions that are both accurate and efficient.

With all that said, I’m confident that we would be able to provide you with solutions that will help you scale your business.

Our work:

We created a web platform for recruiters to discover ""sentiment scores"" that convey how employees feel about being at their company. Used by recruiters to poach employees from companies. Uses AI that scrapes data from the web. This project is currently under strict NDA so I’m unable to share a link at this time.

Guy Pistone CEO & Founder - Valere http://www.valere.io/","What is your solution to complet? Tell me code, platform, language, etc.Here's my proposed solution:

Platform and Languages:
Frontend: React.js for building a dynamic and responsive user interface. React is efficient for handling dynamic content updates, which is crucial for displaying real-time social media feeds.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework for the server-side logic. Node.js can handle asynchronous calls well, which is necessary for interacting with various social media APIs.
Database: MongoDB for a flexible, schema-less structure that can easily store user data and preferences as well as the social media content in JSON-like documents.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
APIs Integration: Social media APIs (Facebook Graph API, Twitter API, LinkedIn API) to fetch the relevant content based on user-defined parameters.
Hosting/Deployment: Use a service like Heroku for hosting the MVP. It integrates seamlessly with Node.js and offers a free tier for small-scale applications.

Development Approach:
Prototyping: Start by improving the mockups to design a clean and intuitive UI/UX.
Setup Development Environment: Initialize the project with Node.js and React, setting up the necessary dependencies and development tools.
User Authentication: Implement user signup and login features.
User Preferences Storage: Allow users to define and store their preferences (hashtags, profiles, keywords, pages) in MongoDB.
Social Media Integration: Develop modules for fetching data from different social media channels based on user preferences.
Content Display: Create components in React to display the fetched content in tabbed views as per the selected social media channel.
MVP Testing: Conduct thorough testing of the MVP with potential users to identify bugs and gather feedback.

Future Considerations:
Once the MVP has been validated in the market, you can prioritize additional features such as sorting algorithms, trend analysis, and expanding the list of supported platforms.

Implement caching strategies or consider using a service like Redis to manage the increased data load.
Integrate more complex data analytics for trend detection.
Consider scalability options, such as moving to a cloud solution like AWS or Azure, which can provide more robust services for scaling up the application.

Code and Deployment:
Version Control: Use Git for version control, with GitHub or GitLab to host the repository.
Continuous Integration/Deployment: Set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.
This approach provides a balance between cost-effectiveness and the potential for scalability. The MVP will serve to validate the concept in the market, and the chosen technologies will allow for easy expansion and feature integration based on user feedback and market demand. lessWill data be saved to database, or is it all done in real time?The system would ideally use a combination of both real-time data processing and database storage for efficiency and performance.

Real-Time Data Processing:
The latest content or posts from social media channels would be fetched in real time using the APIs provided by each platform (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).
The user would see the most current information as the system queries the social media APIs when the user selects a particular tab or refreshes their feed.

Database Storage:
User accounts and their preferences (such as defined hashtags, profiles, keywords, and pages to follow) would be stored in the database (like MongoDB).
This persistent storage ensures that when users log in, their preferences are retrieved and used to fetch the relevant content from social media channels.
For performance optimization, the system could cache frequently accessed data or store historical data trends for quick retrieval without making API calls for data that doesn't change often.

Combining Both:
While the live feeds are generated in real time, the application could also save snapshots of the data at regular intervals to build a historical view. This would be essential for the ""trends"" feature to analyze data over time.
The system could also cache some of the real-time data temporarily to reduce the number of API calls and improve the user experience by providing quicker load times.",https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626730405085184

We are the one-stop shop for development when you want it done right!

For one of my first startups, I tried going the full-stack route. Then when it came to building upon v1.0 and bringing other developers onto the team, I, unfortunately, realized the backend code was trash. The architecture wasn't set up correctly, so we had to scratch EVERYTHING and start all over. I don't want to put anyone through the same headaches I had to deal with.

We're committed to providing a comprehensive and integrated approach to development, ensuring that we deliver a product that you can build upon rather than a ""one and done"" project code.

🔸Reasons why we are a great fit for your project:
-We have experience with Agile methodologies to align with your priorities
-We will assign a project manager to your project who communicates effectively, both orally and in writing, with UX/UI Professionals, Product Development Engineer(s), Quality Assurance, 3rd-party vendors (if any), Senior Leadership, and end-customers (technical and non-technical)
-We break down work into Minimum Viable Products (MVP) and iterate quickly on preferred product changes
-We offer architecture recommendations, will walk you through a user flow diagram, provide data modeling, a plan of development, and detailed user story(ies)
-We also provide dedicated dev-ops to ensure server security. We support and maintain AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure cloud services.
-And most importantly, aside from our proven track record, we’re passionate, dedicated, and invested in our work

Front-End Development,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~019f8645dac1a4bdd5,"That headline perfectly describes what we are looking for.
Is it OK if I’m completely honest with you? Here are the qualities I’m seeking:
Detail-oriented: A really good front-end developer who misses a few of the details can end up causing a lot of back and forth. And I know that’s not fun for you. The solution is to make notes upfront and cross-reference them before sending out your work. Some people truly enjoy being detail-oriented, and some can do it for a while. I can tell you with certainty that we’re always expecting detailed, error-free work, so if that isn’t your style, you will not enjoy working with us. And I very much want you to enjoy yourself.
Likes routine: Don’t get me wrong. Inventing new things is fun, but routine is also beautiful. I can speak for myself: I’d rather sit in my corner and work on what I enjoy versus dealing with a new drama every day. We love routine. If you’re the same, you’ll like this mission.
Is efficient: Oftentimes, people quote low prices to get the project, but they work slow. People who charge $20/hr beat our front-end developers who charge $30/hr.
But if this $20/hr developer takes 3 hours to some front-end code and the $30/hr resource takes 2 hours, I’m better off hiring the more expensive resource.
Rate games are silly. Charge your worth and focus on doing good work.
A little about us: we’re a marketing agency that sets A/B tests for clients. We use testing tools like http://vwo.com/ and http://convert.com/. An example: https://www.loom.com/share/164a8a2e7c494e459de3c16647406cf2
Once we have a test winner, you will be required to hardcode it on the client’s site, so knowledge of Shopify and WooCommerce is a must.
Looking for a front-end developer (solo practitioner, not an agency) with proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript is essential.
Why you should apply: I am trying to find a candidate who has these 3 qualities:
Is detail-oriented (doesn’t miss details)
Like routine
Is competent
Is efficient
Is responsive on WhatsApp
And I’m willing to pay a lot for someone with these qualities.
So here’s the deal: let’s start with $30/hr, and if, within 90 days, you can demonstrate the 5 qualities above, you immediately qualify for a new hourly rate of $80/hr. If this sounds fair, let’s chat.","Hi Rishi and Simon! Happy Monday.

It's refreshing to come across a listing that pinpoints exactly what you want. You're seeking not just a developer, but a craftsman of code who treats routine with reverence. This approach is the cornerstone of how we operate at Valere. I know you're looking for an individual developer; however, let's get on a call so I can break down in fine detail why, for the same rate, you can have an army of coders at your disposal.

In my tenure as CEO, I've fostered a culture where meticulous attention to detail is the norm. It's not just about getting the job done; it's about elevating every detail to its utmost potential. And when it comes to routine, we don't just enjoy it; we thrive in it. There’s a unique satisfaction in perfecting the regular rhythms of coding, much like a composer with their symphonies.

Efficiency is our shared language. We're on the same page that value trumps the allure of low rates. It's not about the time spent, but the milestones achieved. To that end, we've streamlined our processes to ensure that every hour is an investment towards unequivocal quality.

I'm sorry to hear that you've had a difficult path finding a developer who sticks with the project and takes it seriously. I'm curious though, after all these experiences, why are you still not considering an agency?

I can’t tell you how many clients have come to us looking for help after their freelancer randomly jumped ship or delivered poor quality code that made it impossible for them to scale. The thing is, freelancers can be a single point of failure. If they become unavailable or face personal issues, your project could stall. A team approach mitigates this risk as there are backup resources and a project manager to ensure continuity.

But I guess I should introduce myself. I'm Guy Pistone, father, husband, Celtics fan and the driving force behind Valere (http://www.valere.io/). I have spent over 10 years creating award-winning software that is fast, attractive, responsive, and easy to use. I'm proud to say that I have earned an Expert-Vetted Badge from Upwork, which ranks me among the top 1% of software development talent on the platform. My work has been featured by Apple, Google, TechRadar, and The New York Times!

Building software is a lot like constructing a bridge – it requires a solid foundation, meticulous planning, and constant maintenance to withstand the test of time. You NEED a reliable partner for the long haul, especially for a complex and evolving project like yours. My team and I have a track record of establishing strong, lasting relationships with our clients, ensuring continuous support and development.

In fact, check out BeeLine Transport Hive- We developed an end-to-end management platform for mobile and web that delivers high ticket items for retailers.

We go through all the use cases and determine where the issues processare. We communicate to the developer who then debugs the issues. All of this is done in a test environment using test data. Then, we replicate a “production environment” database, and migrate that data to a “development environment”. In the development environment, we can test the application again using real-live production data, replicating real world use cases. After we see the build is stable, we push the application live.

Mobile App Development,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01916e3dc5ce1b9b2f,"We are seeking an experienced iOS developer with expertise in the Screen Time API to assist us with our mobile app. Our app, built using Flutter, is facing significant challenges with integrating certain iOS-specific features. We need your help to overcome these blockers and ensure a seamless user experience.

Key Responsibilities:

Blocking Apps for Specific Days of the Week

Implement a feature allowing users to block certain apps on specific days.
ShieldConfigurationExtension Integration

Add ""opens for today"" in the ShieldConfigurationExtension, as specified in our design.
Managing App Limits and Scheduled Blocks

Handle two types of blocked apps: App Limits and Scheduled Blocks.
Ensure scheduled blocks take precedence over app limits.
For instance, if a user has a scheduled block restricting Facebook from 9 am to 5 pm and an app limit of 5 uses for Facebook, the scheduled block screen should appear during the restricted period. The app limit applies only outside of the scheduled block period.
Determine if separate ManagedSettingsStore are needed for each type.
Manage cases where a user selects the same app multiple times.
Handle scenarios where a user selects an app and a category that includes that app.
Home Page Chart Development

Develop a chart for the home page based on the provided design.
Requirements:

Proven experience with iOS development and the Screen Time API.
Ability to interpret and implement designs from Figma.
Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
Excellent communication skills.","Hey Bailey, iOS can often be a pain in the A S S when you're working with APIs with limited experience. Is this your first time trying to implement Screen Time API or are you just running into new issues you've never encountered before? With extensive experience in iOS development and expertise in the Screen Time API, I am confident in my team's ability to help you overcome these blockers and enhance your app's user experience.

Valere has worked on multiple projects where integrating iOS-specific features was crucial for the success of the application. Here are some examples from our portfolio:

FlyVirga: We developed an app for pilots that integrates with various APIs to provide real-time data, social features, and PIREP reporting recognized by the FAA. This project required handling complex data and ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/fly-virga/id1524210560
Sukhi: We built an iOS app for workplace well-being that streams live workshops and on-demand audios. This app required precise integration with multiple APIs to manage real-time data and user interactions efficiently. https://apps.apple.com/in/app/sukhi-workplace-well-being/id1585123698
Elete Dribbling Training: This app uses AI and augmented reality to provide basketball training. We managed large datasets and ensured high performance, demonstrating our capability to handle complex user interactions and data management. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elete-dribbling-training/id1454189239?ls=1

Finding the perfect freelancer can be a challenge. At Valere, we understand that. We've built a proven track record of success on Upwork helping clients achieve their goals. See our journey for yourself in this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDcMvffuyF8

Technical Approach:

Tech Stack: Utilize Swift and Objective-C for iOS development, ensuring smooth integration with the existing Flutter codebase.
API Integration: Leverage the Screen Time API to implement the required blocking and monitoring features.
Design Implementation: Work closely with the provided Figma designs to ensure the UI/UX is consistent and meets the project specifications.
Testing and QA: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work seamlessly across different iOS devices and scenarios.

Timeline:

Requirement Analysis and Planning: 10-15 hours
Feature Development:
Blocking Apps for Specific Days: 20-30 hours
ShieldConfigurationExtension Integration: 15-20 hours
Managing App Limits and Scheduled Blocks: 25-35 hours
Home Page Chart Development: 15-25 hours
Testing and QA: 20-25 hours
Total Estimated Time: 95-150 hours

Potential Bottlenecks and Big Lifts:

API Limitations: If the Screen Time API has limitations, we will explore alternative approaches or workarounds to achieve the desired functionality.
Complex Scheduling Logic: Handling overlapping schedules and multiple selections may be complex, but with careful planning and testing, these challenges can be effectively managed.

I'd love to learn more about your project and showcase how we can help you achieve your vision. We'll also share our proven process and more relevant client work based on your vision and goals.

We can start off with some simple tasks so we can get to know eachother and see how it works. But as long as we are working with a developer who responds it should be all okay. If you are interested please let us know. We have immediate work and would like to get started right away. Thank you for your interest!Requirements:- Full Stack Developer (Front End, Back End UI/UX)- Communication is a must- Fixed price/Pay by task- No agencies

","Hi Rob and team! I'm sorry to hear that you've had a difficult path finding a developer who sticks with the project and takes it seriously. I'm curious though, after all these experiences, why are you still not considering an agency?

I can’t tell you how many clients have come to us looking for help after their freelancer randomly jumped ship or delivered poor quality code that made it impossible for them to scale. The thing is, freelancers can be a single point of failure. If they become unavailable or face personal issues, your project could stall. A team approach mitigates this risk as there are backup resources and a project manager to ensure continuity.

But I guess I should introduce myself. I'm Guy Pistone, father, husband, Celtics fan and the driving force behind Valere (http://www.valere.io/). I have spent over 10 years creating award-winning software that is fast, attractive, responsive, and easy to use. I'm proud to say that I have earned an Expert-Vetted Badge from Upwork, which ranks me among the top 1% of software development talent on the platform. My work has been featured by Apple, Google, TechRadar, and The New York Times!

Building software is a lot like constructing a bridge – it requires a solid foundation, meticulous planning, and constant maintenance to withstand the test of time. You NEED a reliable partner for the long haul, especially for a complex and evolving project like yours. My team and I have a track record of establishing strong, lasting relationships with our clients, ensuring continuous support and development.

In fact, check out BeeLine Transport Hive- We developed an end-to-end management platform for mobile and web that delivers high ticket items for retailers. It allows dispatchers to schedule and assign shipments and drivers could access information regarding their current and previously assigned shipments. The platform processed over 20,000 transactions, significantly improving efficiency and reducing operational costs.

",,Local SEO
Machine Learning,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0159bbbe66e7112ccb,"Here is a brief about what is needed at this first stage of our product development:
Text-To-Speech
Speech-To-Text
Interruption Engine
Short-Term Session Memory
Long-Term Important Information Memory
Emotional Speech Engine - Multiple ElevenLabs models to express different emotions, based on sentiment of input and sentiment of output.
Prompt Engineering for natural sounding-conversation outputs.
Computer Vision & Transformer Vision Context
Simple ChatGPT-like Desktop UI for Demonstration and Testing. Example attached.
This conversational Agent will become part of a larger project, specifically a Linux Based OS for a hardware Display/Monitor and will later on be integrated to use applications within that OS (Not part of this project but should be developed with that in mind).

To develop a highly conversational agent that will integrate into an operating system, we need to focus on several key components. The first component is speech-to-text technology, which will handle input from the user and translate it into text. Next, we have text-to-speech synthesis, which will convert the generated text back into speech. Between these two, we will incorporate a conversation engine powered by an appropriately prompted instance of ChatGPT.

For the text-to-speech functionality, we must address several aspects to ensure the system is truly conversational. An interruption engine is essential, which would likely involve a machine learning algorithm to detect whether the user intends to interrupt or has finished speaking. This could integrate voice activity detection software, such as PicoVoice, and potentially a custom machine learning solution. Additionally, we need to incorporate emotional speech synthesis. One approach is to create various professional models with Eleven Labs, each specialized in a particular emotion. This way, based on the sentiment of the message or specific sections, a different model would generate the speech, providing the appropriate emotional tone. Alternatively, we could explore the possibility of developing a single Eleven Labs model trained on a large corpus encompassing a wide range of emotions, ensuring high-quality outputs with the right emotional tones.

Another critical aspect is short-term session memory, which maintains context over brief interruptions so that users can pause the conversation and resume later without losing continuity. For longer-term memory storage, we would implement retrieval-augmented generation techniques and use a vector database to store information. This system would analyze conversations to identify important details for long-term storage and manage retrieval, ensuring relevant context is provided to the model while avoiding duplicate storage.

Our overall structure follows a script-based format, similar to a movie script, where different speakers are named, and visual context is included where relevant. Speaking of visual context, we also need robust computer vision capabilities. For simpler tasks, traditional convolutional neural networks can be used, such as determining the number of people in a room. For more complex image analysis, transformer-based vision models will provide more nuanced responses.

Finally, effective prompt engineering is crucial to ensure the responses from the model are natural and conversational rather than overly formal or technical. The goal is to create a system that feels casual and engaging, enhancing the user experience by making interactions with the operating system more intuitive and human-like.

We’re open to hearing alternative solutions to these sections if they are more efficient or better suited.","Hi, I appreciate the invitation to check out your project. It's definitely within our wheelhouse and I am interested to learn more and to share more about our team at Valere. Before we schedule a meeting, I want to be transparent about our company policy. We have a limited number of AI developers and are fully committed to producing high-quality work, which is why we only pick projects that we have a strong affection for. This means that our developers will work exclusively on your project during the entire development process, engaging quality assurance, designers, and project manager to ensure everything is going smoothly and make sure we give you a product that could be built upon as your business grows. For this reason, we are very selective about the projects we choose to work on.

As part of our commitment to delivering top-notch software development solutions, we ensure that every client we work with has $20k+ for long-term software development. This allocation doesn't have to be for the first task/project specifically, but we want to ensure that we partner with clients who are looking for a long-term software development partnership for all their future needs, assuming you're completely satisfied, which in 99% of cases, our clients are. We spend a lot of time and mental energy on every client, that is why we only pursue long term relationships.

Let me know if this aligns with your long-term interests and bandwidth for your project.","In what order would you tackle the components of this project.To develop a highly conversational agent for integration into a Linux-based OS, begin with the STT functionality to handle user input, followed by TTS for generating responses. Next, develop the Interruption Engine to manage user interruptions naturally. Implement Prompt Engineering to ensure natural-sounding conversation outputs and integrate the Emotional Speech Engine for appropriate emotional responses. Incorporate Short-Term Session Memory for maintaining context during interruptions, followed by Long-Term Memory for storing significant details across sessions. Finally, integrate Computer Vision for visual context and develop a simple desktop UI for testing and demonstration purposes. lessWhat is your experience with ML?We’re an expert vetted software development team with extensive experience crafting revolutionary AI and machine learning solutions and have a clear understanding of the intricate dance between technology and business goals.

Web Design,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0157024868109462cf,"Hello,

I found your pieces site http://www.species-in-pieces.com/# when I was looking for site examples for a design concept, I had for our security guard company.... I'm an outside the box type creative thinker and I love the pieces concept - I love sites that are entirely above the fold and I like the idea of mixing not just graphic design but 3D animation into a website like you are telling a story..

This is going to be long and hopefully not too confusing lol pi

The main page when you first get to the side will be almost fully animated it will show a building meant to look like our headquarters with a palm springs California skyline in the back I even want subtle things like maybe a plane flies in the sky or birds if you wait long enough....

when the page first loads and shows the background the skyline is visible but the building looks a little dark on the outside.... our mascot (Sam Rock) drive the patrol car from the right off screen and parks in front, gets out you hear his steps and him whistling as he walks to the left in front of car to the left front of building and turns on the lights you here that neon signs buzz sound start up and the O'Linn logo sign lights up and another sign with the phone number lights up as well... he walks over to the lower right side of the building --- he kind of acts like he hears something ""what was that"" shines his light on the side of the building turns around and says oh... then starts the scene that exists currently on our site here ---olinnsecurityinc.com (click play) when the character says ""number listed up there"" he points to lit number sign then starts to walk towards car and says or fill out our security request form when he says that you see it illuminated with a window sign that is clickable when clicked it pops up a center request form to fill out. he finishes his lines as he is getting in the car and drives off screen to the left.... you are left with just the scene background of the building menu tabs (somewhere that the fit nicely) and you then navigate to your first page...

Here is my idea… the “cover page” for the following pages will be animated done by 3D company

- About O’Linn
- Our Services
- Testimonials
- Contact

On the About O’Linn page you will have a cool background maybe the office and skyline scene but with signs lit up on the office windows to choose from the following

Who We Are
Our Founder
Team
Gallery

Each of those above pages will operate just like pieces
When you open any of the above options from the about page the menu tabs on the right scroll to only the sub pages

Who we are, Our Founder, Team, Gallery

and each of those pages has a button that says. “Back to About” when you are on the about page there needs to be a way to navigate to services, testimonials, contact, home

The content that is displayed for Who We Are will be in the middle of the page with maybe just a transparent call out box with text in the middle and maybe some bullet points to other text as long as it fits above fold in the middle - the “what’s the threat button” on the side between the menu I think might be hard for people to instinctively know to click so I want that to be a “Dive Deeper” button and maybe more in the middle since we don’t need that text in the middle under the animal. Dive deeper will be that pop up that has maybe more information on the company that you can read / scroll or watch a video.

Same for Our Founder page

Team will be Photo/Name/Tile with bio that functions like a transparent slider in the center 1 person per slide

Kim O'Linn Owner
Jason Morris VP
Adam Dean Director
Chief Operating Officer (coming soon)
Blanca Duck HR/Billing
Iliana Morris Executive Assistant

Video message pop up feature that will be a button under the bio.. contact icons present for each person on their “slide” like an interactive business card

Gallery will be a center slider , 1 image at a time like the pieces animals. (For now) might change that later.

- Our Services will have some sort of animation maybe the palm springs skyline with maybe large billboard street signs to choose a service option when you click one the screen goes black and the content pops up in the middle like when you click for more info on the animal in pieces ( since this can have more text maybe it's scrollable down or the content is like transparent text slides) also maybe a video option that explains the particular service really direct in about 30 seconds. Each service page would function the same.

- Testimonials maybe a similar page to services but with client logos on the signs and then it opens a testimonial written and or video.

Contact ---- need a new and fun way to set up a contact page

I currently have a company making the character and rigging him now but open to someone else doing again if needed. ","Hi Jason,

Generative AI Modeling,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01421213245d05c006,"I'm looking for a developer to consult with on building a generative AI shopping agent.
I will also be writing code so mainly looking for someone with deep experience to consult with

The bot will respond to user queries and use a range of tools and LLMs to provide the answer

The agent needs to ask some follow up questions to refine the search:
- break down the query into parts
- Use RAG over some vectorized documents
- tool calling to an internal API
- support the results with Tavily or other search engine APIs
- generate the results using generative AI / LLMs and a combination of these sources

stack: python with probably llamaindex or langchain
fastAPI
simple front end to demo with (reactJS chat UI)
ideally streaming from client to server

this is for an initial proof of concept so we can test out lots of cutting edge approaches.

the main areas of question:
- how to destructure the user queries
- how to interactively follow up to refine a query
- which framework to use
- formatting queries against a custom schema for internal API calling

In your reply ideally share a github link with some similar projects you've worked on ","Hi Edaan and David, I like where you're going with this LLM-powered shopping agent!

Mobile App Development,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01889c5fe44ac397c8,"Our long-running app developers have quit the business and we're looking for new ones

Our Native mobile Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) apps based on Redux architecture. Libraries used are common (no need more details here).

We are a tuition agency and we have new 50-100 tuition jobs daily. Our native mobile apps are for our registered tutors to view and apply for these tuition jobs. We also send push notifications using firebase to them via our web backend.

The backend and API is managed by another developer. You will be tasked with only mobile apps development.

For this project you will be tasked with 2 things
1) Maintain the apps whenever there are any necessary updates in Android/iOS such as sdk/libraries
2) Implementing new functionalities that we periodically want to add to our apps

Currently, we're facing an issue where our push notifications receive rate is very low (3-5%) and the engagement rate of our app is decreasing over the years. If you can provide the most helpful details on how you'd troubleshoot the issue and ideas on how to improve our push notification receive rates, you will get this project!

So, we've only been sending 1 type of push notification with the title""New Assignment! Apply Now"", the description contains the details of a specific tuition job. (See attached).

Push notifications are sent from our backend system developed using GCP, whereby we filter the tutor type according to the job and then send to the tutors from there. (We're also considering to automate this process.)

According to firebase data, we're seeing extremely low receive rates particularly on Android devices. iOS is much higher even though it still feels low.

P.S. apart from improving our push notification rates, we have a bunch of new features we want to implement on our app, especially gamification and messaging features! This is a test. Begin your job application with the words ""I love dancing in the rain'. Applications without this will be ignored.","I love dancing in the rain, but I live to build native mobile Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) apps based on Redux. Hi Rum, sorry to hear your last team of developers up and quit on you. It's a shame to hear that people don't have the same respect for what sounds like a solid work opportunity.

And as far as your declining engagement rate goes, I'm already thinking up of some great ideas to move that from 3-5% higher than it's ever been before. In our previous Upwork projects, we've achieved impressive results for clients in your very situation. To see for yourself, start by watching our Upwork success story here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDcMvffuyF8 and then let's schedule a call to talk about your goals.

My team and I have extensive experience developing cross-platform mobile applications using both Kotlin and Swift. These applications would work seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices, providing your customers with a consistent user experience.

With my experience in developing high-quality, scalable, and user-friendly software applications, I believe I can provide the skills and expertise necessary to help you achieve your business goals.

Back-End Development,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0119c7d67cfcb74b33,"We are looking for an experienced NLP expert to design, develop, and implement software solutions that leverage natural language processing techniques to transform diverse textual corpora into knowledge graphs. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in NLP, machine learning, and software engineering, with a passion for turning unstructured data into structured, meaningful information.

Key Responsibilities:

- Design and develop NLP algorithms and models to process and analyze large corpora of text.
- Implement and optimize software that converts unstructured text data into structured knowledge graphs.
- Must have experience with embeddings, vectorization (WMD, Word2vec, etc.)","Hi Drew, when you choose someone for this project, I imagine you're going to be looking for an expert. See if you can find someone here in this link https://investors.upwork.com/static-files/180457e2-1f5a-4b9b-8d0c-ee28a8e56341 it's not that long, but if you start on page 5 you'll see an Upwork named AI expert.

To keep proving that we're the experts you need, here's a simplified breakdown of how we'd get this done:

1. Data Preparation & Preprocessing:
- Collect Textual Data: Gather the text corpus (e.g., news articles, social media posts) you want to analyze.
- Clean & Preprocess Text: Remove noise, standardize formatting, and perform tasks like tokenization (breaking text into words) and stemming/lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).
2. NLP Model Development:
- Choose NLP Techniques: Select appropriate NLP techniques like named entity recognition (NER) to identify key entities (people, places, etc.) and relationship extraction to identify connections between entities.
- Train NLP Models: Train algorithms on a portion of the preprocessed data to recognize entities and relationships within the text.
- Evaluate & Refine: Evaluate the trained models' performance and fine-tune them if necessary for improved accuracy.
3. Knowledge Graph Construction:
- Entity & Relationship Representation: Use techniques like word embeddings (WMD, Word2vec) to represent entities and relationships numerically in a vector space.
- Knowledge Graph Creation: Build the knowledge graph structure by connecting entities based on the identified relationships. This graph can be stored in a database format for further analysis and exploration.
4. Optimization & Deployment:
- Optimize Performance: Refine the NLP models and knowledge graph structure to ensure efficient processing and accurate results.
- Deployment (Optional): Depending on the project's goals, consider deploying the solution as a web service or integrating it with existing applications.

We helped Anroku build an app that interacted with their smart-locks to let their customers setup, lock, and unlock their Anroku locks using wifi and bluetooth. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anroku-com/id1532384427

Tyme Wear is the first wearable that accurately measures endurance, and individualizes your training. We developed their app.

A venture-backed company, Elete became the most addictive and advanced app to develop ball-handling skills. Powered by Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality, it uses your device's camera to track the ball as users build basketball skills in a gamified way. We used Computer Vision and Machine Learning to make improving your basketball skills fun!

UX/UI Design,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~0111fa728fe2707e3c,"We are seeking an expert UX/UI Designer & Quality Analyst for one of our projects. This dual-role position requires a professional with extensive experience in user experience design and quality analysis, specifically within the healthcare industry.

Required Skills and Experience:

- Expert-level proficiency in UX/UI design
- Proven experience working with physicians and building/testing UX/UI for physicians
- Strong knowledge of design tools (e.g., Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD)
- Proficiency in UX/UI QA testing methodologies and tools
- Excellent communication and collaboration skills
- Detail-oriented with a strong focus on user experience and quality","Hi Zeshan and Monika, we have created, designed and developed, HIPPA-compliant infrastructure, worked with huge health players like Johns Hopkins University, and created internal and B2C solutions in the healthcare space. My team and I have had great experience designing websites across several verticals. I’m confident that our experiences and expertise will lend themselves well to the design and QA of your project.

The main difference would be instead of a single player to do the design and testing, you would get an expert in both design and QA testing. And I could provide more experts if you needed help on something else. Being a team, we can work in tandem on various parts of the project to ensure it comes out perfectly. Are you just needing help with UX/UI and QA?

My next question to you is.. are you ready to stand out?

We help brands find their voice, create a strong visual identity, and dominate their niche. Just like we've done for countless clients over the past 10 years. Our work has even been featured by giants like Apple, Google, and The New York Times!

We offer a full suite of branding and design services, including:

- Brand Strategy: Develop your unique voice and visual identity.
- UX/UI Design: Craft user-friendly and visually stunning experiences.
- Prototyping: Test and refine your ideas before development.
- Creative Direction: Set the tone and ensure brand consistency.

And here are a few examples to show what that would look like in action:

I'm Guy, Founder of Valere (http://www.valere.io/), developer of groundbreaking projects, proud husband, sports enthusiast, and father of two amazing boys.

I've spent 10+ years creating award-winning software that is fast, attractive, responsive, and easy to use. I have thousands of hours logged on UpWork and I'm proud to say that I've earned an Expert-Vetted Badge from Upwork, which has ranked me among the top 1% of software development talent on the platform. My work has been featured by Apple, Google, TechRadar, and the New York Times!

I have a team that is extremely diverse in terms of our skill set, capabilities, and experience across Web3 Development. We have been heavily focused in the Crypto & NFT space and feel like these experiences and expertise will lend themselves well to the development of your project. And that's not all. We have vast experience building sports apps! This means we understand what athletes and fans crave – immersive, engaging, and easy-to-use applications.

As you probably already know, finding GOOD crypto/blockchain/NFT developers right now that are available and not backlogged for months is nearly impossible.We have recently become available and are looking for our next big project. With that being said, we only pick projects that we have a strong affection for, and after reviewing your project description, I honestly believe that this seems like a great fit. I’d like to entertain the idea of building something incredible together.

I strongly encourage you to check out a few recently completed projects that showcase our diverse skills in the blockchain space.

We helped Mintable create one of the first open-sea-esq platforms where you can mint your own NFTs, track important stats in the blockchain world, and even sign up for their DAO.

We also helped Crypto Homes create the first fully functional marketplace to buy and sell homes using cryptocurrency.

Guardrails is a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that protects organizations from data breaches and security threats. We contributed the UX/UI for Guardrail, a Saas for Web3 companies to manage security. Through the use of thoughtful design, we managed to present complex data in a way that is both user-friendly and easy to navigate.

We developed Ultimate Odds- an app that combines sports betting lines and odds with a fantasy format into one experience. All you have to do is enter a contest, pick your lineup of bets, and whoever has the highest score wins – no need to hit all your bets. Plus, Ultimate Odds offers the most competitive contests and the best interface in the industry.

We helped Lucky M create their custom NFT minting site in record speed. We created this site so it could be built upon, just like the NFT upgradeable smart contracts involved. Since this site is not live I cannot share additional information, but I'll be more than happy to hop on a call and show you some wireframes.

We also helped one of our clients develop an NFT fantasy game in which players play-to-earn PVP/PVE by participating in battles with theirNFT characters. Players received various types of rewards depending on the game type.

I was trying to do it by implementing a GSM module with Arduino and in this way communicate it to a local server and thus be able to receive the calls and connect it to a platform like RetellAI.

I am looking for someone to give me feedback on the business model and implementation ideas I have, as I'm a total novice. Long term, I need someone to advise us on how to grow the company in the future.

You see, our team is not just a collection of skilled developers; we are a well-oiled machine with a track record of delivering high-quality, innovative solutions.

One of the most Fulling project was is support for Alzheimer’s research. This cause hits close to home— I lost my father to the disease in 2020. Motivated by this personal loss, by the end of the following year, I had steered Valere into a partnership with Johns Hopkins University. Together, we developed an app that allows researchers to gather better data on Alzheimer’s patients and glean further insights into how Alzheimer’s disease works. This initiative is not just a professional milestone but also a deeply personal endeavor to combat a disease that has significantly impacted my life.

Train an AI model to be used to simulate communication between humans and dogs and cats.
However, this communication needs to be super fun. The answers need to be silly, sarcastic, and smart ass. The idea is to develop a model to make people laugh with the answers.
Features
Voice recognition (Similar to Alexa).
If possible, customers can choose from several different voices of Male, Female, Adult, and children.
If possible, customers can choose from several different languages.
The ability to recognize and answer the largest number of questions possible. However, every time the question is asked again, the answer needs to be different from the last time. (We should have between 5 to 10 different answers for each question).
The ability to register the name of the dog/cat to be used as the awake word for the device.
The ability to have the client add questions and answers to the device. (Customization). If possible, do so by using the voice recognition feature. This way, we probably won’t need an app to do that.
The model should be able to recognize the dog/cat’s owner, either by their voices or faces (Can a small camara be used?).  (This feature is not a requirement)
The model must be able to fit in the smallest Rasberry PI available in the market. (Or equivalent. So long is small) or any microchip set that would work.
I envision all the information to be stored in the cloud and to be accessed via WiFi. (just like Alexa, but on a much smaller scale).

Here are examples of existing ai generators ....UDIO, Hydra, Jukebox by google, Magenta, Aiva, Amper, IBM Watson, Wave AI’s Alyssia.


To create an AI music generator, you'll need a combination of technical skills, musical understanding, and creativity. Here are some essential skills:

1. Programming and Machine Learning:
- Python: Proficiency in Python is crucial. Most AI music generators are built using Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.
- Machine Learning: Understand the basics of machine learning, including neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative models.
- Deep Learning: Familiarize yourself with deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent layers.
- Data Preparation: Learn how to preprocess and represent music data (e.g., MIDI files, audio spectrograms) for training.","Hi Marco, I love projects in the music industry. We've even built some pretty cool ones if you ask me, take a look here:

Machine Learning,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013096f10ed12e3fe7,"We are an Internet job board in Bolivia, and we have a lot of data that could be used to implement artificial intelligence in our platform. We currently do not have anyone in our team who knows about AI. Therefore, we are looking for an ""AI generalist"" who can guide us through the process of discovering and deciding where we can use AI in our platform and then help us set up a team to implement this.

What is an AI Generalist? The AI generalist is not necessarily an expert in any AI field but has enough knowledge about the general AI landscape to know which technologies would be most appropriate for our project. Maybe you are an expert in one AI field but know enough about the other fields relevant for this project. Then you are an AI generalist and a good fit for our project.

Our data is in Spanish, but you do not need to speak Spanish to do this job. It would obviously be helpful to know at least some Spanish, but it is by no means something that will disqualify an applicant.

Initially this is an advisory role only, meaning that the person we hire for this project will do a high-level analysis of the kind of data we have and will provide suggestions on what we can do with AI. Then this person will help us set up a team to do these implementations. If the AI generalist can also work on these implementations, we are certainly open to this.

For example, we have around 500k resumes and 100k job postings. The resumes are very well organized, meaning that every job experience, education and skill is stored in a specific field in the database, so there is no need to guess what type of data it is. This can be especially useful for machine learning since the data is already tagged. Many job boards save Word or PDF documents, and with this format the information is much less organized.

We also have an extensive internal knowledge base which could be used with a LLM to help our team find the information faster.

We would also like to implement some ChatGPT style functions wherever it is a good idea.","Hi there, Esteban! I have a team of AI experts led by an MIT grad who was working for Apple and Uber as an engineering manager before I swooped him up. And it just so happens that team is located in Bogotá, Colombia. Así que como bonus, tenemos un equipo que habla español al nivel nativo y podemos ser su generalista de la IA tanto en inglés como el español. Cómo usted prefiera.

I'm no native speaker, but I pick up on a few things with so many here in our offices. I think we could make a great team here and I'm already envisioning how we would start advising you on this job market project. But I'll be honest, I don't want to just ""advise"" and if you let my expert AI developers help you implement these systems, your team can start to pick up on the in's and out's of AI.

We wouldn't charge you for the consultancy role, only for developers and the hours you needed. I think it's crazy people pay to get told what they should do. I don't know what level of skill your team currently has, but some of our suggestions may be too much for them to handle. So, it's better to have the advisor to tell you which way to go, and the developer to lead the execution while your team is learning along the way, don't you think?

And when it comes to AI for job boards and recruiting efforts, my team really shines here. Check this out:

Describe your recent experience with similar projects
I've included project links and descriptions in our cover letter in addition to attaching a PDF version of our portfolio. Once we learn more about your vision and project details, I'd be happy to demo projects that align more with what you're looking to build. In the meantime, I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have regarding what I’ve shared so far and how it may relate to your project.

Describe your approach to testing and improving QA
We have a QA that starts with manual QA. We go through all the use cases and determine where the issues processare. We communicate to the developer who then debugs the issues. All of this is done in a test environment using test data. Then, we replicate a “production environment” database, and migrate that data to a “development environment”. In the development environment, we can test the application again using real-live production data, replicating real world use cases. After we see the build is stable, we push the application live.

Being a founder myself, I know how frustrating it can be to deal with bugs and have developers who never fix them!

That's one of the reasons I started Valere. We have a dedicated team of 6 quality assurance experts testing your application across multiple devices. We test every possible user story and functionality thoroughly. We purposely try to break the app to spot any edge cases that we can fix before product release.",Python Ruby API JavaScript Zapier API Integration API Development RESTful API

The successful candidate will be responsible for developing and maintaining the front-end and back-end applications of our online education platform. UX/UI design + technical support and maintenance are a must.

Our goal is to develop an MVP of our platform in full stack development to include 6 main features (to be discussed with candidates).","Hi there, welcome to Upwork! I'm Guy Pistone, Valere's CEO (http://www.valere.io/). My team and I’ve been at the helm of software engineering for a decade, weaving the technical with the educational, to craft platforms that are not only functional Your vision for an online education platform that is as robust in its backend integrity as it is intuitive in its front-end experience speaks to the core of my expertise and passion.

But before diving into details, I have to warn you about the full-stack developer route. You see, for one of my first startups, I tried going the full-stack route. Then when it came to building upon v1.0 and bringing other developers onto the team, I, unfortunately, realized the backend code was trash. The architecture wasn't set up correctly, so we had to scratch EVERYTHING and start all over. I don't want to put anyone through the same headaches I had to deal with.

Going with Valere means having a dedicated front-end and back-end developers, a designer, quality assurance, and a project manager on the team. We are the one-stop shop for development when you want it done right! We're committed to delivering a product that you can build upon rather than a ""one and done"" project code.

So, let's dive right into details! Here’s what I propose:

Collaborative ideation session: Let’s start with a deep dive into your six main features, aligning each with the educational outcomes you aim to achieve.
Rapid prototype development: Post ideation, transitioning swiftly to wireframes and prototypes, giving you a tangible feel of your MVP in action.
Iterative user feedback loops: Leveraging iterative design sprints to refine our approach based on real user feedback, ensuring the platform evolves in rhythm with its users’ needs.
